FCC timestamp project

Decided to not use Express and just use Node.js http instead.

The service can be found here https://cryptic-ridge-10208.herokuapp.com/

It could probably use checks to validate but maybe later..
It handles errors by logging them.
It does deal with favicon requests by returning status 204 no content.
